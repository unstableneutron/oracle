# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.5 — 2025-11-15

### Added
- Logs the masked OpenAI key in use (`Using OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxx****yyyy`) so runs are traceable without leaking secrets.
- Logs a helpful tip when you run without attachments, reminding you to pass context via `--file`.

## 1.0.3 — 2025-11-15

## 1.0.2 — 2025-11-15

## 1.0.2 — 2025-11-15

### Added
- Positional prompt shorthand: `oracle "prompt here"` (and `npx -y @steipete/oracle "..."`) now maps the positional argument to `--prompt` automatically.

### Fixed
- `oracle status/session` missing-prompt guard now coexists with the positional prompt path and still shows the cleanup tip when no sessions exist.

## 1.0.1 — 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- Corrected npm binary mapping so `oracle` is installed as an executable. Published with `--tag beta`.

## 1.0.0 — 2025-11-15

### Added
- Dual-engine support (API and browser) with automatic selection: defaults to API when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise falls back to browser mode.
- Session-friendly prompt guard that allows `status`/`session` commands to run without a prompt while still enforcing prompts for normal runs, previews, and dry runs.
- Browser mode uploads each `--file` individually and logs Chrome PID/port for detachable runs.
- Background GPT-5 Pro runs with heartbeat logging and reconnect support for long responses.
- File token accounting (`--files-report`) and dry-run summaries for both engines.
- Comprehensive CLI and browser automation test suites, including engine selection and prompt requirement coverage.

### Changed
- Help text, README, and browser-mode docs now describe the auto engine fallback and the deprecated `--browser` alias.
- CLI engine resolution is centralized to keep legacy flags, model inference, and environment defaults consistent.

### Fixed
- `oracle status` and `oracle session` no longer demand `--prompt` when used directly.
